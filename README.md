### UGV code repository of the MBZIRC Challenge II

This repository contains code that was used for the ground robot of the CTU-UPENN-NYU team during the MBZIRC 2020 Challenge 2.
Most of the code is based on traditional ROS AMCL/move-base navigation customized for large areas, vision-based navigation [[1](#references)] and fast and accurate segmentation technique [[2](#references)].
The code is free to use in non-commercial applications. If you decide to reuse the components of this repository in your work.
Original codes of the aforementioned methods are available at <b>https://github.com/gestom/stroll_bearnav</b> and <b>https://github.com/gestom/whycon_orig</b>.
